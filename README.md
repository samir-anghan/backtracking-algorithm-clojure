# The treasure hunt game (backtracking algorithm) using Clojure functional programming language

## DESCRIPTION
It’s	time	to	try	a	little	functional	programming.	In	this	assignment, you	will	have	a	
chance	to	gain	experience	with	the	Clojure programming	language.	The	program	itself	 _should_ be
relatively small.	However,	you	will	have	to	think	a	little	about	the	algorithm	in	order	to	actually	
produce	a	working	solution.	In	the	process,	you	should	get	some	sense	of	the	syntax and	style	of	a	
functional	language.

In	terms	of	your	task,	it	can	be	described	as	follows.	You	can	assume	that	you are an	intrepid	
explorer,	searching	for	buried	treasure.	Specifically,	you	are	underground,	wandering	through	a	
series	of very	dark	tunnels. You	have	no	light	and	no	signs	to	guide	your	way.	All	you	can	do	is	
blindly	feel	around	and	wander	through	the	tunnels	until	you	hopefully	enter	the	room	that	
contains	the	treasure.	You	can, however,	leave	a	trail	of	breadcrumbs	behind	you so	that	if	you	
come	to	the	end	of	a	tunnel	and	you	can’t	go	any	further,	you	can	get	back	to	where	you	were	and	
try	again	in	another	direction.	


This	may	all	sound	very	abstract,	but	a	simple	example	will	illustrate	what	has	to	be	done.	A	map	of	
the	tunnels	will be	stored in	a	simple	text	file.	The	map	is	used	by	the	application	to	determine	if	the	
explorer	can	move	in	a	certain	direction.		The	map	could	look	like	this:

```
---#--###----
-#---#----##-
####-#-#-#-##
---#---#-#---
-#-####---##-
-#------#----
-############
------------@
```

Here,	the	 **_–_** characters	indicate	that	you	are	free	to	move	in	this	direction.	The	 **_#_** character	indicates	
that	you	cannot	move	any	further	in	this	direction	and	you	should	go	somewhere	else.	The	 **_@_**
character	indicates	the	location	of	the	treasure.	In	this	case,	it	is	in	the	bottom	right	corner, but	it	
could	be	anywhere	in	the	map.

In	your	application,	you	will	always	begin	searching	in	the	top	left	corner	of	the	map.	So	when	you	
run	your	code,	you	might	print	something	like	the	following to	the	screen:

```
This is my challenge:
---#--###--#-
-#---#----##-
####-#-#-#-##
---#---#-#---
-#-####---##-
-#------#----
-############
------------@

Woo hoo, I found the treasure :-)

+++#--###--#-
!#+++#+++-##-
####+#+#+#!##
+++#+++#+#!!!
+#+####++!##!
+#++++++#!!!!
+############
++++++++++++@
```

Note that we first print the current map and then indicate success or failure. In this case,
we were successful. You will also see that the map has been updated to indicate how the
walk was done. The + characters indicate the path that led to the treasure. The ! characters
indicate the tunnels that were tried but did not to lead to a viable path. Note, for example,
that after starting in the top left corner, the explorer tried to go down but that path was a
dead end. So a ! was used to mark a bad path and then the explorer went to the right, which
eventually lead to the treasure.
Let’s modify the input file and try another treasure hunt.

```
This is my challenge:

---#--###--#@
-#---#----##-
####-#-#-#-##
---#---#-#---

Uh oh, I could not find the treasure :-(

!!!#!!###!!#@
!#!!!#!!!!##-
####!#!#!#!##
!!!#!!!#!#!!!
!#!####!!!##!
!#!!!!!!#!!!!
!############
!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

In	this	case,	there	was	no	way	to	get	to	the	treasure.	The	**_!_** characters	indicate	that	we	tried	almost	
every	possible	pathway	but	eventually	had	to	give	up (there	is	one	 **_–_** location	that	we	couldn’t	
reach).	 Oh	well.	

So	that’s	the	entire	problem.	You	will	read	the	map	from	a	file	called	 **map.txt** (in	the	same	folder	as	
the	application),	try	to	find	the	treasure,	and	then	provide	a	final	updated	map	that	shows	how you	
explored	the	tunnels	and,	of	course,	whether	you	were	successful	or	not.
